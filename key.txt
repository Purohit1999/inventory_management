Humble Appeal to Hindu Organizations and Mandirs :

Namaste,

With deep respect and a sincere heart, I write this message as a concerned Pravasi Bharatiya (Overseas Indian) who remains deeply connected to Bharat—emotionally, culturally, and spiritually.

Today, I humbly urge you to raise a matter of critical importance before the BJP government, Hindu organizations, Mandirs, and community leaders.

1. Protection of Pravasi Bharatiyas’ Properties in India :
Many of us living abroad are facing increasing threats to our properties and interests in India. The current legal and administrative system, often tainted with corruption, puts us at great risk. We fear unjust land grabs, harassment by local authorities, and prolonged legal battles—especially when we cannot be physically present to defend our rights.

Even as we support the nation and align with its cultural revival, our vulnerabilities are growing. We respectfully ask for concrete steps and **policy-level safeguards** from the government to protect the assets and dignity of Pravasi Bharatiyas.

2. Social Justice Under SDGs – A Silent Crisis :
India has rightly committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, under the umbrella of "Education" and "Social Justice", a concerning trend of social engineering has emerged. This includes divisive narratives that increasingly pit female against male, creating mistrust and disunity among families and communities.

As highlighted by journalist Sudhir Chaudhary (DNA), one man commits suicide every four minutes in India, yet this alarming crisis receives little to no attention. Neither Hindu organizations nor political parties—be it BJP, Congress, or others—have seriously addressed this imbalance. Silence on this issue is dangerous.

3. A Wake-Up Call for the Future of Bharat :
If this trajectory continues unchecked:
- Future generations may lose their cultural identity.
- They may become divided, “woke,” and alienated from dharmic values.
- There will be chaos within society while political elites continue to enjoy privilege and comfort—regardless of party lines.

---

A Call for Unity and Responsibility :
This is a humble but urgent plea to the community. Let us not allow silence to become complicity. We need Hindu organizations, Mandirs, and cultural institutions to speak boldly, act wisely, and advocate for:
- Protection of Pravasi Bharatiyas and their interests.
- A balanced and dharmic approach to social justice.
- Unity, not division, among our people.

May we rise above party politics, uphold Dharma, and secure a just and harmonious future for all.

With deepest gratitude and respect,  
Naradrabhai
